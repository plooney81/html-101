    <p>Here's a couple of ways to express yourself</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
        <li>
            <em>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You did it! you should be proud of yourself</p>
